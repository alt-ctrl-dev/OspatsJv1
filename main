# This file "main" must be run to call function
# ospatsmr() or allocatemr(), after filling in the name
# of the data file and the process parameters below.
# Data file: no header, comma-separated values, x, y, prediction
# and prediction error variance in column 1, 2, 4 and 5.
#   The main differences with the previous version (2017) are that the code 
# has been upgraded to Julia version 1.01, and that the functionality of
# drawing a sample has been dropped.
