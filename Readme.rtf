Two main differences between package '91OspatsJv1' and the older package '91ospats' are:
1) they are written in Julia version 0.6 and version 1.01, respectively,
2) the function of drawing a stratified random sample from the grid has been dropped in 'OspatysJv1'.

A small data set, 'Nowley.txt' is provided for testing the code after installation.
